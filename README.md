# refactorcode
For this activity I took an existing code and modified it using HTML and CSS.
I modified this existing code to check for any repititions or redundancy in the code and scoped out where code could have been omitted without changing the outcome of the code.
I broke up the code using identification tags and class tags and made another file using CSS.
CSS would outline the whole dynamic and major parts of the code and would shorten up the existing code so users wouldnâ€™t see too much going on at once.
This code includes 4 identification tags with subclasses, subheadings, and paragraphs used to describe the ID tags.
This code also describes how you can utilize web search engines and social media to build a reputation for your brand and describing the benefits of doing so.
